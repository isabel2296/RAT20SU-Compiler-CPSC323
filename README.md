# RAT20SU-Compiler-CPSC323
Write a Lexer Analyzer, Syntax Analyzer using RDP, and Tables to hold assembly language instructions

Co-writters: Isabel, Joseph, Loai


main.cpp - contains Lexer Analyzer;

SA.h, SA.cpp - contain the Syntax Analyzer and Production of Tables for assembly instructions

When you execute the executable the user will be prompted to enter a file name. The results of the executable will be located in “outAssembly.txt”, if there are syntax errors the executable program will exit and print the error. Please do the following:
1. Unzip project file and place all test (.txt) file’s in the same directory as executable. Note: If files are not located in the same folder as the executable, the program will not be able to locate the file.
2. Execute CPSC323_proj.exe on a Windows Computer, the program will prompt you for a file name.
3. Once the file is read the program will exit and the output file
“outAssembly.txt” will appear along your test files. Note: the outAssembly.txt will be overwritten for every test file. If you wish to save the output file please rename or take it out of the directory where the .exe is located.
For the purpose of this assignment we placed screenshots of our results.
